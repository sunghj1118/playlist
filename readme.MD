## This is my first repository!

**I'm HyunJoon and this is my first GitHub repository.
If you see any files on my project, it's because I'm learning Git.**

I am currently writing a playlist program in C++.


Things I want to implement in the future for my program are:
* Shuffle-play and standard play option
* Implement 'Song' classes so it becomes easier to their artists.
* Add a favorites tab that tracks how many times one has listened to a song.

My mood:

My favorite color:

Thank you so much for reading! â˜º
